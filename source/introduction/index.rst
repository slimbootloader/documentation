Design Philosophy
-------------------

Platform firmware has two primary responsibilities:

* **Initializing the hardware**
* **Booting an Operating System**

Designing platform firmware can be monolithic combining hardware initialization and boot functionality, *OR* it can take a modular and staged boot flow. The choice of the design depends on system requirements.

Separating initialization and boot logic is desirable for certain device classes, for example, IoT devices, as it provides the flexibility for unique use cases. A good example is the choice of operating system used in IoT devices - it is typical to deploy OS having unique boot requirements. The OS may vary from standards based like Windows using UEFI to embedded OS or RTOS using OS specific boot protocols.

|PN| (|SPN|) is designed with the modular approach by providing hardware initialization, then launching a *payload* to boot OS.


Features
------------

|PN| is designed to be:

* **Small**

* **Fast**

* **Secure**

* **Extensible**

* **Configurable**


In addition, it provides built-in features:

* **Multiple OS Support**

* **Firmware Update**

Frequently Asked Questions
---------------------------

What is |PN| (|SPN|)?
    |PN| is an open-source boot firmware, built from the ground up to be small, secure and optimized running on Intel x86 architecture.

What platforms are supported by |SPN|?
    Initially, |SPN| supports the following |APL|: |UP2| board, Intel Leaf Hill CRBs and QEMU virtual machine. More platforms supported information can be found here, (See :ref:`supported-hardware`). 

What license does |SPN| use?
    |SPN| is released under BSD plus Patents |License|.

What are options to debug |SPN|?
    |SPN| supports source level debugging using Intel UEFI Development Kit (UDK) debug tool (via UART). Depending on the board configuration, developers can also debug |SPN| with Intel trace hub, secure debug token (if enabled) or memory buffers.

Is Embedded Controller (EC) supported?
    No. Different boards may have different EC or SuperIO. Developers need implement the code for the target board.

Does it support RTOS?
    |SPN| features loading x86 ELF executables in its payload stage. We have verified loading Open Source Zephyr RTOS (See :ref:`boot-zephyr`).

What tool chains are supported to compile |SPN|?
    |SPN| supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019 and GNU GCC toolchains (gcc 9 or newer). Additional tools including Python (3.8), nasm, and IASL are required to build |SPN|.

    The current version of BaseTools is stable/202011 from EDKII open source project.

Does |SPN| support verified boot and measured boot?
    Yes. |SPN| supports both from software point of view. In order to enable hardware root-of-trust in |SPN|, the Intel stitching software kit is required. For measured boot, |SPN| supports TPM (Trusted Platform Module) 2.0.

Does |SPN| support SMM?
    |SPN| does not support SMM. If SMM is required, a new |SPN| payload can be created to support it.

Does |SPN| support Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware update?
    |SPN| has a built-in firmware update payload that features power-fail safe mechanism. OS specific OTA support can be implemented based on the provided firmware update interface in |SPN|.

Does |SPN| support splash screen?
    Yes. Custom splash screen can be enabled or disabled (for boot performance) via |SPN| build options.

Does |SPN| support legacy boot?
    |SPN| currently does not support option ROM or CSM mode.

Do you have a porting guide for new boards?
    Please visit and search :ref:`developer-guide` section first. We plan to post step-by-step porting guides with more details.
