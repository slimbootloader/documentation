Simics® QSP Virtual Platform
-----------------------------

What is Simics®?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Simics simulator is the functional virtual platform technology used in
`Intel® Integrated Simulation Infrastructure with Modeling (Intel® ISIM) <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/integrated-simulation-infrastructure.html>`_.
The Simics simulator has been designed to let virtual platforms run target binaries in a fast, deterministic, and controllable way.
This provides an ideal environment for early software development and debugging, analysis, tracing, and instrumentation of software running on the platform.

Here is an interesting article for further reading about Simics:
`Simics® 6 A Deeper Look at How Software Uses Hardware <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/blogs/simics-6-looking-at-how-software-uses-hardware.html>`_

.. note::
  In this guide, we will focus on how to boot up on Simics Quick-Start Platform (QSP). |br|
  The QSP is a simple model of a standard PC, and is part of the Simics base product.


Setting up Simics® Simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please head over to this link to understand and setup Simics® Simulator:

`Simics® Simulator Public Release <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/simics-simulator.html>`_


Please refer to the guide bwlow to get your Simics Simulator setting up!

`Simics® Simulator Installation and Get Started <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/simics-simulator-installation-and-get-started.html>`_


Here is a snapshot of Simics Simulator after setting up:

Building |SPN| for Simics QSP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Time to get ready with |SPN|!

.. note::
  Before trying on |SPN|, you are **strongly recommended** to at least go through the Tutorial section in Simics Simulator to get yourself familiarized with it.

  Please refer to Get Started section `here <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/simics-simulator-installation-and-get-started.html>`_



To build |SPN| for Simics QSP (it is the same image as QEMU, SBL will auto detect the platform at runtime)::

    python BuildLoader.py build qemu

.. note::
  QSP |SPN| shares the same image as QEMU |SPN|, |SPN| will auto detect the platform at runtime via Host Bridge Device ID.

The output images are generated under ``Outputs/qemu/SlimBootloader.bin`` directory.

.. note:: QSP |SPN| does not require stitching the |SPN| into an IFWI.



Boot to Shell on QSP Simics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start Simics Simulator. You should be able to see the Simics Control Panel pop up:

.. image:: /images/simicscontrol.jpg


Now proceed to load **SlimBootloader.bin** using Simics CLI method (in Simics terminal)::

  simics> run-command-file targets/qsp-x86/firststeps.simics bios_image = "/home/(SlimBootloader.bin path)"

A graphics console and a serial console will pop up:

.. image:: /images/simicsloadsbl.jpg


Then 'turn on' the platform::

  simics> run


**Booted to SBL Shell!**:
