Shell Interface
----------------

|SPN| comes with a built-in shell interface for diagnosis and debugging purpose. It allows one to examine platform state (e.g., dump memory content, PCI configuration registers, etc.), change boot configuration and trouble shoot before launching OS.

Developers can also add their own shell commands for unit testing.

To enter shell interface, press any key after reboot and before OS is launched.

Built-in shell commands::

  Shell> help
  boot     - Print or modify the OS boot option list
  cdata    - Display configuration data.
  cls      - Clear console
  cpuid    - Read CPU specific information
  dmesg    - Print messages stored in boot log buffer
  exit     - Exit the shell
