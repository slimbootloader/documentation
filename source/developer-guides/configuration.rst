Configuration
---------------------

Ease of platform and board customization is one of the most important design goal of creating |SPN|. It has many benefits from both system perspective and business use cases. For example,

* By using a centralized configuration infrastructure code, it is easier to manage all configuration related data in all boot stages in the same way
* Because configuration data is *packed* into a central region in |SPN| image, it is easier to customize these changes, or add security protection, or optimize its footprint.
* By defining a standardized human readable configuration format, it is easier to create tools to provide user interface to manage many platform configurations.


|SPN| has two sets of configuration data in the image:

Internal configuration data
  Software default values. It is unchangeable once |SPN| is built. In case of external configuration data is not available or corrupted, internal data is loaded instead.

External configuration data
  Platform specific data which is configurable by tools. It can be protected with user provided key.

|SPN| configuration infrastructure includes the following and is designed to support multiple boards with one firmware image. 

* Configuration declarations in YAML files
* Configuration deltas in DLT files
* Configuration tools


.. _Configuration Files and Configuration Flow:


YAML Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* All platform configuration settings including memory, silicon, GPIO, OS boot policy, security settings etc are declared in a custom format and uses YAML Syntax.
* YAML configuration files, in general are located in project specific board folder, while some common configuration files are located at Platform\CommonBoardPkg\CfgData. 
* For example, you can find the configuration files for Apollo Lake platform under Platform\ApollolakeBoardPkg\CfgData folder.

Please note that you may find many YAML files. However, only CfgDataDef.yaml is the primary file used for the platform configuration, and other sub YAML files will be 
included by the primary YAML file to provide component specific configuration.

The main platform configuration file is specified in CfgDataDef.yaml. An example configuration file in YAML syntax is provided below.

.. image:: /images/ConfigDefYaml.png


DLT Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* DLT (delta) files are used to provide overrides to settings in YAML files to address board-level differences, including GPIO, boot policy, PCIE configuration, security settings etc.
* DLT files contain unique Platform ID, and build tools will apply the settings to firmware images based on the platform ID.
* DLT file that overrides configuration parameters for all boards (board id 0) is also supported. A typical use case is in case of Platform ID as explained below.

DLT file can be generated in different ways:

* Change any existing settings, and save it to DLT file with Configuration Editor Tool.
* Load values from an existing binary file, and then save the changes as DLT file. 

A project may include multiple DLT files to handle multiple boards and are included in the project's BoardConfig.py file as below. 
self._CFGDATA_EXT_FILE    = ['CfgData_Ext_Def.dlt', 'CfgData_Ext_Gpmrb.dlt']

Configuration Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. image:: /images/ConfigFlow.png


During |SPN| build, the configuration data in the YAML files are parsed by the configuration tools to generate the header files as well as the configuration binary. 
In addition to generating and stitching of configuration binaries through |SPN| build process, editing of configuration parameters post build is also supported.

Post-build configuration update can be done with the project's configuration YAML/DLT files and the updated configuration binary can be restitched without having to rebuild |SPN|
project. 

All the configuration tools required by the configuration process can be found under BootloaderCorePkg/Tools folder.



Configuration Editor Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
|SPN| supports a Configuration Editor Tool (ConfigEditor.py) to configure firmware settings with graphics UI. This tool is included in |SPN| source package at BootloaderCorePkg/Tools.

.. Note:: An example pre build configuration flow to configure GPIOs can be found here https://slimbootloader.github.io/how-tos/configure_gpio.html#gpio-config-data

.. Note:: An example post build configuration flow to configure Boot Options can be found here https://slimbootloader.github.io/how-tos/change-boot-option.html#change-at-post-build-time


.. _platform-id:

Platform ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: Platform ID and board ID are used interchangeably in this section

|SPN| uses platform ID to select the associated configuration data. The platform ID can be specified at build time or dynamically detected from GPIO pins at runtime. At the beginning of Stage 1B (``GetBoardIdFromGpioPins()``), |SPN| attempts to load GPIO platform ID by tag ``CDATA_PID_GPIO_TAG``. If the tag is found, the actual platform ID value is read from the GPIO pins. Otherwise, |SPN| uses static platform ID.

|SPN| supports up to 32 platform IDs. Note that Platform ID **0** served to carry the default CFGDATA values defined in the CfgDataDef.yaml file. So it cannot be used for a real board. So technically, SBL can support upto 31 boards.

.. note:: In addition to board specific delta files, a DLT file that overrides configuration parameters for all boards (board id 0) is also supported. If platform ID needs to be configurable without source, DLT file for board ID 0 is required. This is useful when common board settings are to be changed without changing the platform configuration DSC file.




Platform Configuration Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _static-platform-id:

Platform ID Configuration
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. Provide platform ID (1-15) value in board configuration file (``*.dlt``):

.. code::

  PLATFORMID_CFG_DATA.PlatformId                  | 0x7

2. Build |SPN| and stitch IFWI image



.. _dynamic-platform-id:

Platform ID Detection using GPIOs
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

1. Configure designated **4** GPIO pins in board configuration file using |CFGTOOL|.

2. Provide platform ID value (0-15) in board configuration file (``*.dlt``):

.. code::

  PLATFORMID_CFG_DATA.PlatformId                  | 0x9

.. note:: Internally, |SPN| adds 16 to Platform ID detected using GPIOs in order not to conflict with static IDs.

3. Build |SPN| and stitch IFWI image


Common Configuration Categories
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
|SPN| comes with commonly used configurable options for a given platform. One can add new configurations (``Platform/<platform_foo>/CfgData/*.yaml``) and Stage 1B board specific code (``Platform/<platform_foo>/Library/Stage1BBoardInitLib/``)

Configuration data are grouped by categories:

* GPIO
* Memory and eMMC tuning
* Graphics related
* Device related (USB, eMMC etc)
* Security
* Boot options
* Feature related (e.g., log level)
* ...

Configuration data is loaded and verified in Stage1B. Once loaded, |SPN| groups related configuration item by *tags* and the data can be retrieved by calling function ``FindConfigDataByTag()``. For example, ``CDATA_USB_TAG``.
