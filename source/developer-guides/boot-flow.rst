Build Process
--------------

|SPN| build process is implemented in top level build script ``BuildLoader.py``. The following diagram illustrates main steps:

.. graphviz:: /images/build_steps.dot

The generated files are located in ``Build/`` directory.

The |SPN| image, configuration data, and (generated) helper scripts, are located in ``Outputs/`` directory.

.. Note:: To assist debugging, the build process also generates ``SlimBootloader.txt`` file which contains flash layout details for each component in |SPN| image.


.. _boot-flow:

Boot Flow
-------------

|SPN| uses a linear staged boot flow to initialize platform and launch OS. It consists of four stages:

========= ================
Stage      Description
========= ================
Stage 1A   Pre-memory initialization
Stage 1B   Initialize main memory
Stage 2    Post memory initialization: initialize CPU, I/O controllers, devices etc.
Payload    Load, verify and launch OS images; or perform firmware update
========= ================

.. graphviz:: /images/boot_flow.dot

.. Note:: When verified boot is enabled, each current stage verifies the next stage before transferring control to the next.
  If verification fails, one of two things occurs. If resiliency is enabled, the boot is swapped over to the alternate partition
  to recover the broken partition (see :ref:`firmware-resiliency-and-recovery`). Otherwise, the boot is halted.

.. _call-graph:

End-to-End Call Graph
-----------------------

The function call graph in |SPN| code from reset vector to OS launch.

.. image:: /images/call_graph.png
   :width: 600
   :alt: |SPN| Calling Graph
   :align: center

.. Note:: This call graph changes if resiliency is enabled and recovery is attempted (see :ref:`firmware-resiliency-and-recovery`).



Platform Initialization
-------------------------

In |SPN|, board initialization code is located in ``Platform/<platform_foo>`` directory. Each stage provides a 'hook point' for board specific code. To port a new board, one should implement changes in ``BoardInit()`` function for each stage under ``Platform/<platform_foo>/Library`` directory::

    VOID
    BoardInit (
      IN  BOARD_INIT_PHASE  InitPhase
      );


During board initialization, |SPN| further divides the flow into multiple phases to provide a fine granularity control. These phases are defined in ``PlatformService.h``::

    typedef enum {
      PreTempRamInit     = 0x10,
      PostTempRamInit    = 0x20,
      PreConfigInit      = 0x30,
      PostConfigInit     = 0x40,
      PreMemoryInit      = 0x50,
      PostMemoryInit     = 0x60,
      PreTempRamExit     = 0x70,
      PostTempRamExit    = 0x80,
      PreSiliconInit     = 0x90,
      PostSiliconInit    = 0xA0,
      PrePciEnumeration  = 0xB0,
      PostPciEnumeration = 0xC0,
      PrePayloadLoading  = 0xD0,
      PostPayloadLoading = 0xE0,
      EndOfStages        = 0xF0,
      ReadyToBoot        = 0xF8,
      EndOfFirmware      = 0xFF
    } BOARD_INIT_PHASE;
